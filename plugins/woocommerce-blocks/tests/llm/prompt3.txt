Cabbage Acres is a 5th-generation family run farm outside of Portland, Oregon. We sell a variety of fresh produce and meats from our 1,000 acre organic farm. Our most popular products are:

- Weekly CSA box of fresh fruit and vegetables
- Free range, grass fed beef (ground beef, steaks, and more)
- Free range, organic feed eggs from our happy chickens

Unlike most large-scale farms Cabbage Acres is a family operation as we’ve been farming the same land since the early 1900s. Our prices might be higher than the local grocery store but you’ll be sure to get high-quality, great-tasting produce right from your own community.
