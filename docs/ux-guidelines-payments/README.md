When building payments extensions, you should ensure you follow the [WooCommerce Extension Guidelines](./user-experience-guidelines).

Payments plugins come in many types: payment processors and gateways, wallets, Buy Now Pay Later, crypto, and more.

The choice between payment plugins depends on the specific needs and preferences of the merchant and their customers. Some merchants may choose to use multiple types of payment plugins to offer their customers a wider range of payment options.
