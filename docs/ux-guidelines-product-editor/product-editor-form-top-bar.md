Top bar extensions offer supplementary experiences **not vital** to the critical product creation flows. They're secondary, meaning that they shouldn't contain information that may impact the product's overall quality or completeness.

Each top bar extension has its unique icon in the top navigation bar. Note that when the number of extensions exceeds 4, they're truncated in a dropdown menu.
