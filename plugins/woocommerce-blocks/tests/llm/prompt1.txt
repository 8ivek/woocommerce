At Upright Productivity we sell custom, handmade standing desks. 
We have 3 base models of desk to choose from: Space Saver, Standard, and Corner Executive. Everything is handmade by our team of craftsmen in our Portland, Oregon workshop and we ship worldwide. 
Unlike lots of companies we use locally sourced materials, from steel forged in Oregon to wood harvested from our forests. 
Most of our customers are work-from-home professionals who want the flexibility of a sit/stand desk with the values of supporting a local business and economy.
