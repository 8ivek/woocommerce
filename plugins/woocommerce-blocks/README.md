Feature plugin for the Gutenberg Products block.

**Getting Started:**
1. Make sure you have Gutenberg 2.2+ and WooCommerce 3.3.1+ installed and active. There were some changes in the way gutenblock scripts are enqueued in Gutenberg 2.2, so this won't work with earlier versions.
2. Get a copy of this plugin using the green "Clone or download" button on the right. Activate the plugin.
3. On Gutenberg posts you should now have a Products block available.

**Developers:**
1. Follow the Getting Started instructions above.
2. `npm install` to install the compiler dependencies.
3. `npm run build-gutenberg` or `npm run build-gutenberg-watch` to compile the code.

The source code is in the products-block.jsx file and the compiled code is in products-block.js.
